		<div id="desc">Based on the concept of the flaneur, strolling through the arcades of Paris, flaneur·io allows its contemporary equivalent to capture digital findings in form of text fragments gathered while browsing the web. Links, which emerge in the collection of digital content, transform to paths. Following them allows the viewer to pass from one fragment to another.<br/><br/>Flaneur·io is a bachelor project by Fidel Thomet, designed and developed at the Zurich University of the Arts Interaction Design Programme. The project is inspired by the idea of the Information Flaneur introduced by Marian Dörk.</div>
